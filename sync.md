### ECM sync approach
The ECM model (based on encrypted files) allows the use of almost any syncing solutions. For instance, if you work on your laptop you may sync your vault to any cloud storage, e.g. Dropbox or PCloud, and ECM built-in usage of [rclone](https://rclone.org/) will allow you to sync files among your tools, e.g. sync files from Dropbox to your mobile phone. Said that, the ECM provides a web server which you may deploy at your premises, e.g. on LAN or WAN, on your laptop, router or remote VirtualMachine, on cloud provider infrastructure or any cluster. And, usage of HTTP protocol will allow you to use web server REST API to fetch or upload your encrypted content to your web server.
