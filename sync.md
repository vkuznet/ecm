### ECM sync approach
The ECM model (based on encrypted files) allows to use almost any
syncing solutions. For instance, if you work on your laptop you
may sync your vault to any cloud storage, e.g. Dropbox or PCloud,
and ECM built-in usage of [rclone](https://rclone.org/) will
allow to sync you files among your tools, e.g. sync files from
Dropbox to your mobile phone. Said that, the ECM provides
a web server which you may deploy at your premises, e.g.
on LAN or WAN, on your laptop, router or remove VirtualMachine,
on cloud provider infrastructure or any cluster. And, usage
of HTTP protocol will allow you to use web server REST API
to fetch or upload your encrypted content to your web server.
